## Traffic Lights

In this activity, you will create a simple circuit that mimics the operation of a real traffic light using three different colored LEDs: red, yellow, and green.

 By connecting these LEDs to your Raspberry Pi, and writing a basic program, you will control the LEDs to turn on and off in a specific sequence. This sequence simulates the timing of a traffic light, where the red LED is on for a few seconds, followed by the green LED, and then the yellow LED for a shorter duration before repeating the cycle.
