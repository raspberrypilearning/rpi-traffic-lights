## What can I do next?

How about adding some new features to your Traffic Lights?

Try adding a [button](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-button-switch){:target="_blank"}  for a pedestrian crossing. The button should move the lights to red (not immediately), and give the pedestrians time to cross before moving back to green until the button is pressed again.

Next, try adding a [buzzer](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-buzzer){:target="_blank"}  to beep quickly to indicate that it is safe to cross, for the benefit of visually impaired pedestrians.
