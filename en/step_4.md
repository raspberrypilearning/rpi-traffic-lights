## What can I do next?

--- task ---

Try creating the full traffic lights sequence:

- Green on
- Amber on (Green off)
- Red on (Amber off)
- Amber on (Red stays on)
- Green on (Amber and Red off)


Be sure to turn the correct lights on and off at the right time, and make sure you use `sleep` to time the sequence in order.

How about making a pedestrian crossing function for your Traffic Lights?

Try adding another [button](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-button-switch){:target="_blank"}  for a pedestrian crossing. The button should move the lights to red (not immediately), and give the pedestrians time to cross before moving back to green until the button is pressed again.

Next, try adding a [buzzer](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-buzzer){:target="_blank"}  to beep quickly to indicate that it is safe to cross, for the benefit of visually impaired pedestrians.
